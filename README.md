# MEGATILER with SGDK

This is a repository for study purporses. This was made following the [tutorial
from OHSAT GAMES](https://www.ohsat.com/tutorial/megatiler/megatiler-1/). There
you can have the complete tutorial with everything you need.

You will also find here a `CMakeLists.txt`, that was created with the only
purpose of making my NeoVim development environment work well, and a
`.clang-format` file to automate code formmatting.
